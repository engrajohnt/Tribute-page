                        loved them ever since the first one. Steve jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He
                        has inspired me to one day and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to
                        own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will
                        dearly miss Steve jobs he's a great man and i will never forget him.

                    <p class="coment">What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story i ve writtenas an
                        adult (and certainly everyone that has been published) almost every email i ve written, has been
                        written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using Apple an Apple machine long
                        before i ever encountered a PC. Steve jobs helped to realize the star Trek future i dreamed of
                        as a kid. And through his vision, i have been able to realize my own. You will be missed, Mr
                        Steve Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.
